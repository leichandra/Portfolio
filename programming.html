        Only Google SSO is enabled at this time, so you can sign in through

      <p>Meal Plan Shop is a web app that users can use to plan meals and shopping lists. 
        At the later stages, the app will sync with Google Calendar and users will be able to post
        their grocery items onto their Google Calendar and shop without forgetting the items
        they want to buy. It is a pair programming project with with my mentor and uses the Django framework, python, css, javascript, 
        html. I started
        this project in order to learn about RESTful APIs and the app development cycle.
